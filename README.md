# bc31.3_RecursionExercise
This project contains JavaScript functions that demonstrate recursion for common data structure and algorithm problems, including:

- Calculating the product of an array
- Finding the longest word
- Selecting every other letter in a string
- Checking for palindromes
- Finding the index of a value in an array
- Reversing a string
- Gathering all string values from a nested object
- Performing binary search on a sorted array

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```
npm install
```
```
jest
```

---

For learning and practice purposes.

## Note

This exercise also had two additional challenges, but the instruction link was broken for boggle and split-square.
